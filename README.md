# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect Div Tag Closure in innerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to using innerHTML to modify the content of an element.  The issue arises from incorrectly closing a div tag within the string passed to innerHTML, which can lead to unexpected rendering behavior and layout problems in the browser.

## Bug Description:
The bug occurs when attempting to add content to a div using innerHTML.  The closing tag of the div is inadvertently included within the new content string instead of being placed after the new content. This causes the browser's HTML parser to encounter an unexpected closing tag, potentially leading to invalid HTML and rendering inconsistencies. 

## Solution:
The solution is to correctly place the closing div tag after the appended content string within the innerHTML assignment.
